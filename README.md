<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on utilizing genetic algorithm to enhance portfolio optimization and predict stock prices. It aims to develop a framework for improving portfolios by optimizing asset allocation, with the ultimate goal of achieving an optimal return-to-risk ratio. The project involves gathering historical price data for 10 diverse assets and then applying genetic algorithms through the GA package to optimize portfolio weights, striking a balance between returns and risk
