# Portfolio Optimization and Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project uses a genetic algorithm to optimize portfolio allocation and predict stock prices. We aim to improve portfolio performance by balancing returns and risks.

## Key Components
1. Data Collection: Historical price data for 10 assets.
2. Genetic Algorithm: Optimize portfolio weights for better returns-to-risk ratio.
3. Predictive Modeling: Random Forest algorithm to forecast stock prices.

## Results
- Optimized Portfolio: Expected return of 0.31%, risk of 5.48%.
- Comparison: Outperformed Balanced and Risky portfolios in risk-adjusted returns.
## Structure
 - data/: Historical price data from NASDAQ
- scripts/: Code for data processing, optimization, and prediction.
- results/: Optimization and prediction results.
- script/: RMarkdown for analysis.

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the creators of the GA package as well as the financial data providers for making this project possible.
